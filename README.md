# URL Shortener SaaS Project

## A fully functional URL Shortener SaaS fullstack project written on React and Golang, where you can shorten your hyperlinks and view use analytics.

This project is my first real try at making a fullstack SaaS web-app. To be honest, I chose this idea quite randomly as I felt it would be a great start, especially since it's not the hardest thing in the world and might be quite useful for some people.
